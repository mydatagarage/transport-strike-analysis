    "The lack of structured analysis makes it difficult to predict the potential impact of a strike and estimate the partecipation level (**business problem**). The purpose of this analysis is to provide public transport's customers with a clear view of strike's partecipation, based on official historical data (**analysis goal**) provided directly by the local transport company, highlighting patterns and trends. The main **derivable** that qualify the analysis as succesfull will be visualizations, tailored on the stakeholders like social media post (3 post with image, labels and charts, along with caption that describes the insights). The final output will be in italian.\n",

Note that the standard **time-bound** reference period for analysis is last 5 years. Trend analyses may use data from 2016‚Äì2023 when historical depth is needed. The standard reference period may vary according to the findings (eg. Covid in 2020 may skewd data) and the last available year may not be complete.\n",
